# Refactor the code for the Great Hikes application I would do the following:
    * Create one root folder called hikes or great-hikes
    * the main html would be added into the hikes folder as index.html
    * Create three folders for images, js and css and add corresponding files into them and import or link to index.html file
    * refactor the json data into a json file in a data folder
    * add css styling to match sample web page model given.
