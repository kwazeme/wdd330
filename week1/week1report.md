# What did I do since the last meeting?
- This week has been a whirlwind of a week so far for me.
    - I have made contact with a few of my fellow students to form a learning team. 
    possibly we may not be able to meet this week as it is; but I have coomunitcated with a few of members of the group
    trying to figure out a good time to schedule our meetinggs for the next 14 weeks.
    from my experience it is better to get that done now and have a fixed time for the meeting so everyone can schedule around it going forward.
    - Then I have done a lot of system set ups. I have done setting up Git, Github, VSCode, Heroku, Heroku CLI, DOcker
    PostgreSql and worked in the intergration of each one of them, I also set up accounts for MondgoDB, though that was for another course.
    -I have read through some pages of "Getting stuff done" and downloaded it and watched the Site point video on UX.
    -Then I set up my WDD330 Portfolio and pushed to Github. I have also set up the structure for my reporting and 
    notes taking for the course.
# What am I going to do next?
    - Continue reading about functions in JavaScript ninja
# What are my blockers?
    - multi-dimemsional arrays. Accessing arrays embedded inside arrays has been a problem for me. I am studing that very carefully so I can get conversant with it.
