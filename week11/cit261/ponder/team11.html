        <h1>Ponder Team Activity: Authentication with JWT</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This week we will dive into one method of authenticating front end
          applications using JSON Web Tokens. The activity will also ask you to
          do a bit of form validation. It may be helpful to review the
          <a href="../prepare/week10.html" target="_blank"
            >readings from last week</a
          >
          before you attempt this activity.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.

              <p>Setup</p>
              <p>
                We need a few things to successfully complete this activity. The
                most important thing is a backend server to respond to our
                authentication requests. Create a folder on your computer called
                <kbd>week11</kbd>. Download
                <a href="../resources/auth.zip">this node server boilerplate</a
                >. Expand it into your <kbd>week11</kbd> folder, then open the
                folder in your editor. We need to install the dependencies for
                this application before we can use it, so you need to open a
                command line prompt and change to the folder that contains the
                server code you downloaded (should be called
                <kbd>json-server</kbd>). Then type:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install</code></pre>
              <p>Once that finishes you can type:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm run start-auth</code></pre>
              <p>
                This will start up our authentication server. It will be
                listening at <kbd>http://127.0.0.1:3000/</kbd> (Note this is a
                local address and can only be accessed from the computer running
                the server).
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  If none of the instructions above look familiar...go and
                  complete the
                  <a href="../resources/workflow.html" target="_blank"
                    >modern workflow</a

                  activity from week09.

              </div>
              <p>
                You should leave this server running until you are done with the
                activity. <kbd>ctrl-c</kbd> will terminate the program when you
                are ready.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                If you are doing this in your portfolio and Github, you will
                want to add a file called <kbd>.gitignore</kbd> at the root of
                your portfolio. In that file add this: <kbd>node_modules/</kbd>.
                That will keep all of the stuff that got added when we ran the
                <kbd>npm install</kbd> from being included in your portfolio.
              </div>
              <p>
                We are also going to be making many AJAX calls for this
                activity. Some will get simple <kbd>GET</kbd>s, but we will also
                need to do our first <kbd>POST</kbd> as well to send the login
                information to our authentication server. We also want to pay
                close attention to handling errors. Begin this activity by
                creating a function we can use to make these requests. It will
                be similar to the <code>getJSON</code> method we created last
                week, but it needs to do more.
              </p>
              <p>If you review that function it looked like this:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
function getJSON(url) {
  return fetch(url)
    .then(function(response) {
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw Error(response.statusText);
      } else {
        return response.json();
      }
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
      console.log(error);
    });
}
              </code></pre>
              <p>
                We can use this as a starting point, but our new function needs
                to allow for different verbs (GET, or POST), and the addition of
                the data we might need to send. We can use this as a model for
                our new function:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
// Server Address
const baseURL = 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/';
// helper function to make an http request with fetch.
// returns a json object
async function makeRequest(url, method = 'GET', body = null) {
  // we will need to set some custom options for our fetch call
    let options = {
    method: method,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  };
  // if we are sending any data with the request add it here
  if (method == 'POST' || method == 'PUT') {
    options.body = JSON.stringify(body);
  }
  
  const response = await fetch(baseURL + url, options);
  // in this case we are processing the response as JSON before we check the status. The API we are using will send back more meaningful error messages than the default messages in the response, but we have to convert it before we can get to them.
  const data = await response.json();

  if (!response.ok) {
    // server will send a 500 server error if the token expires...or a 401 if we are not authorized, ie bad username/password combination, and a 404 if the URL we requested does not exist. All of these would cause response.ok to be false

    console.log(response);
    throw new Error(`${data.status}: ${data.message}`);
  } else return data;

  // not catching the error here...so we will need to catch it later on and handle it.
}
              </code></pre>
              <p>Note a few things:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We are passing in several things...a url, a method that will
                  be set to <kbd>GET</kbd> if nothing else is provided, and a
                  <kbd>body</kbd> argument that will sometimes contain the
                  information we need to send to the API, and sometimes will be
                  null.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will need to send in a custom options object to
                  <kbd>fetch</kbd>. We need to specify method (GET is the
                  default), and then we will need to set some headers. Headers
                  contain information that changes how the server we are
                  communicating to will treat our request. We have set one for
                  now: we tell the server that we are sending/expecting JSON.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Next we check if the method is either <kbd>POST</kbd> or
                  <kbd>PUT</kbd>. Both of these methods involve sending data
                  with the request. We add that to the <kbd>body</kbd> of our
                  request...making sure to convert it to a string
                  (JSON.stringify).
                </li>
                <li>
                  This example also uses async/await to process the Promises.
                  The next line actually makes the fetch request, passing in the
                  URL (which we have been doing) and also our options object
                  (which we haven't done before)
                </li>
                <li>Next we process the response as JSON.</li>
                <li>
                  Now we do some error checking to see if our request worked the
                  way we expected. If it didn't we throw and error, if it did we
                  return the data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Notice that we aren't catching the error here...we will need
                  to make sure we do that later.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Create a folder inside of your <kbd>week11</kbd> folder called
                <kbd>client</kbd> to contain the client side files for the
                project. Create an <kbd>authHelpers.js</kbd> file and put our
                <code>makeRequest</code> function in there...export it. Create
                also an HTML file called <kbd>week11.html</kbd> and add the HTML
                to make a simple page. Create one more file called
                <kbd>week11.js</kbd> and add it to your html via a
                <code>script</code> element (We will be using modules so don't
                forget <code>type="module"</code>). Import in your
                <code>makeRequest</code> function into the
                <kbd>week11.js</kbd> file and test it by trying this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
makeRequest('login', 'POST', {
password: 'user1',

                  Here is a screenshot of my setup for this activity using VS
                  Code and Live Server. Notice the file structure. The client
                  code I am previewing using the Live Server extention
                  (127.0.0.1:5500), and the server code is being run in the
                  built in command line in VS Code (127.0.0.1:3000). (Type
                  <kbd>ctrl+~</kbd> to bring up the command line in VS Code)
                </p>

                  If this were a real application the client and server could be
                  on the same server or different servers, but would most likely
                  have different addresses (instead of just different ports like
                  we have with our development environment). Something like
                  <kbd>my-app.com</kbd> for the frontend, and
                  <kbd>my-api.com</kbd> for the backend.

                If you open the debugger tools and select the "Network" tab in
                Chrome you should see all of the requests that your browser has
                made. Some were to load the html, css, and JS resources, but at
                the bottom you should see one or two requests to
                <kbd>login</kbd>. That was in result of our call with
                <code>makeRequest</code>. Click on the last one. You can see the
                Request and Response headers, and if you select the Response tab
                you can see what was sent back. You should see an object with an
                accessToken in it.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The server code we setup above is running. (You should have
                    a terminal window somewhere that has the application running
                    in it.) Try entering
                    <kbd>http://127.0.0.1:3000/login</kbd> into a browser. If it
                    is working you should see
                    <pre><kbd>{
"status": 401,
"message": "Error in authorization format"

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You are accessing your <kbd>index.html</kbd> file through a
                    webserver. If you are using Brackets or VS Code with the
                    Live Server extention you are. When looking at your html
                    file in the browser check the address. It should start with
                    either <kbd>127.0.0.1</kbd> or <kbd>localhost</kbd>.

              <p>
                The only thing this server will allow us to do without a token
                is login. For everything else we will need to
                <a
                  href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750"
                  target="_blank"
                  rel="noreferrer"
                  >provide the token with our request</a
                >. The most common way to do this is with an
                <kbd>Authorization</kbd> header. In the
                <kbd>makeRequest</kbd> function provided above you can see an
                example of setting a custom header on a request. In that case we
                set <code>'Content-Type': 'application/json'</code>. We can do
                something similar with our authorization header. Before we add
                the header though we need to make sure that a token as passed
                into the function. Let's test for the token after we check for a
                POST or PUT request. Add these lines there.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
  // if a token was passed in we should send it on.
  if (token) {
    options.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
              </code></pre>
              <p>
                You will also need to modify the function declaration to add
                <kbd>token=null</kbd> as a potential argument. (<code
                  >async function makeRequest(url, method = 'GET', body = null,
                  token = null)</code
                >)
              </p>
              <p>That's it...now we can send a token with any request.</p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Login Form and Auth module.</p>
              <p>
                Add a Login form to your <kbd>index.html</kbd>. You will need a
                two inputs: one for the email (username) and one for password.
                Don't forget to add a submit button as well. Create an
                <kbd>auth.js</kbd> file, add a class to it called
                <code>Auth</code> and export it.
              </p>
              <p>
                To help you get your authentication working you can start with
                this code:

                Add the code above to your Auth module. Then import your module
                into your HTML file. Create an instance of your Auth class and
                try calling the login method. If you look in the console of the
                browser you should see a 401 error. Since we did not pass in a
                correct username and password that makes sense.
              </p>
              <p>
                Attach a listener to the submit button on your login form that
                will call the <code>login</code> method from our Auth class when
                pressed. Then finish writing the code for the
                <code>login</code> method.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you have the login working complete the
                <code>getCurrentUser</code> method. Remember that you will need
                to pass the token we recieved from the server with every request
                except for login or the server will reject the request.

              <p>
                After logging in it would be nice to show the user something.
                Create a function to pull all of the posts from the API and call
                it after a successful login. (API endpoint would be
                <code>baseUrl + 'posts'</code>). To have your function called
                automatically after login you can pass the function into the
                <code>login</code> method. It will accept a callback function
                that will be executed if things go well if you used the code
                sample above.

              <p>
                Giving good feedback to your users about what is going on is
                very important...especially when something goes wrong. Let's add
                an Error reporting module to our code to pass messages on to our
                users. Add the following at the top of your HTML body:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div id="errors" class="errors hidden"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
              <p>
                Then create a new class called Errors in your
                <kbd>authHelpers.js</kbd> file. Add the methods to show errors
                in that div when appropriate, and clear them when it is time.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
  export class Errors {
    constructor(errorElementId) {
      this.errorElement = document.getElementById(errorElementId);
    }
  
  }
</code></pre>
              <p>
                Create a new instance of your Errors class to use. Pass it into
                your <kbd>Auth</kbd> class in the constructor so that it has
                access...then use it in the <code>catch</code> blocks when
                appropriate.
              </p>

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
